- 👋 Hi, I’m Denis Lebo. An IT student with a bachelors' from BUT FIT in Czech Republic. Currently I am enrolled in the masters programme at MUNI FI also in Czech Republic.
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development in Python/C#/C++/C. My hobbies are computer games and tabletop games, especially TTRPGs such as DnD5e and PF2e.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# unit testing as an intern at Solarwinds.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects regarding tabletop games or maybe even regular games even though I lack experience in that area.
- 📫 How to reach me either through discord Mr.Otterly#5924 or on my email lebo.denis@outlook.com.
